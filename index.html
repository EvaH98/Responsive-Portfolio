						Hello! You're all wondering who I am right? Well, my name is Eva and I'm an adult in the making. I came to the United States from Mexico when I was three with my family. Since then, I like to call Arizona my home. Here, I grew up, went to school, made friends, found my fiance, and as of currently, study to be a web developer! 
					</p>
					<br>

					<p>
						On a day to day basis I love to spend time with my dog and cat watching TV or watching my fiance rage and scream playing video games. I'm a crafty person, so I'll often do random DIYs if I get the chance (Michael's is my favorite store). If I had the time and the money, I'd defenitly travel a lot. My goal is to visit Germany, Japan and South Korea one day! Overall, I'm a curious person who loves to try new stuff and keep myself busy. There's never a minute when I'm NOT doing something.
